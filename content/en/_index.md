    alt="The image depicts an anthropomorphic white wolf with green eyes, donning a purple wizard hat and cape with gold trims and a red gem. The character is pointing up with a defensive expression, accompanied by a speech bubble that reads, “I'M NOT A FURRY!” This visual is set against a transparent background, highlighting the colorful character. The humor in this image arises from the irony of the character's statement. The term “furry” refers to individuals who have an interest in anthropomorphic animal characters, often dressing up as one or appreciating art related to them. Despite the character's adamant denial, it ironically embodies the very essence of what it claims not to be—a furry, complete with human-like expression and attire typically associated with the furry fandom. This contradiction between the character's statement and its appearance creates a humorous juxtaposition."

While I'm not a furry.. 😹.. I do like wolves and anthropomorphic characters and I happen to like sharing `.safetensors`.

      alt="This is a high-resolution CGI digital artwork depicting two anthropomorphic characters driving through an arid desert landscape with mountains in the background under clear blue skies. The character on the left has dark brown fur wears sunglasses and sips from a red can while seated in the passenger seat of a beige convertible car. This character appears to be male based on muscular build. The driver located on the right side of the vehicle is a white-furred canine wearing black aviator goggles over their eyes and a light-colored safari hat. They also wear a gray shirt tucked into khaki shorts and have a relaxed posture as they steer the car using both hands on the wheel. Both characters exude a sense of leisure and adventure typical of travel companions enjoying a road trip together. Inside the car's interior there's visible leather seating with creased textures adding realism. Outside the vast desert stretches out with its reddish-brown hues and sparse vegetation emphasizing isolation and freedom. The overall style of the art leans towards realistic yet retains cartoon-like features common in furry fandom communities. Shadows and reflections add depth enhancing the three-dimensional effect of the scene."
