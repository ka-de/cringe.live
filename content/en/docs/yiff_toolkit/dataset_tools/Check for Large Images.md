# Check for Large Images

---

This script checks the resolution of all images in a specified directory and its subdirectories. If the resolution of an image exceeds a certain limit, the path of the image is written to an output file. The script uses multiprocessing to speed up the process.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import multiprocessing
import os
from PIL import Image


def check_image_resolution(filepath, output_file):
    """
    Checks the resolution of an image and writes the path of the image to a file if its resolution exceeds a certain limit.

    Parameters:
    filepath (Path): The path of the image file.
    output_file (str): The path of the output file where the paths of oversized images will be written.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    if filepath.suffix in [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png"]:
        img = Image.open(filepath)
        width, height = img.size
        resolution = width * height
        if resolution > 16777216:
            normalized_path = os.path.normpath(str(filepath))
            print(
                f"The image {normalized_path} has a resolution of {resolution} pixels which is more than 16777216 pixels."

            with open(output_file, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write(f"{normalized_path}\n")

    """
    Processes all files in a directory and its subdirectories.

    Parameters:
    directory (str): The path of the directory to be processed.
