## Introduction

---

Puss in Boots is a Spanish-speaking anthropomorphic cat, named for his signature pair of boots. He is an orange-striped cat that is skilled with a sword and his name is derived from the hat and boots he wears. He is voiced by Antonio Banderas and first appeared as a bounty hunter but later became Shrek's faithful sidekick. He is a cat loosely based on the fairy tale character of the same name with the boots, hat, cape, and sword commonly associated with the fairy tale.

Puss in Boots was born and raised with a moral compass, strong sense of justice and valour. Though he may appear self-serving and greedy at times he is actually a very selfless and honorable person. Part of this stems from his small beginnings as a stray, abandoned at an orphanage with the only person who ever had any hope for him was his adoptive mother. Because of this he strives to make her proud by being more than a criminal that others brand him to be. However he is also a survivor at heart and will protect himself and his interests in dubious manners such as becoming an outlaw to fight and steal. Despite this, Puss' high sense of honor prevents him from stealing simply out of selfish reasons and believes in repaying debts. Like many orphans, Puss has a high desire to receive love and affection. This crux in behavior from a typical thief acts as cause to his growing morality during his childhood with Humpty and his growing popularity among the town as a hero led him to abandon thieving ways.
