# NoobAI LoRAs

---

All the LoRAs are trained on one of many versions of the v-pred variant of the model. If you want to be sure which one exactly, your best choice is to check the metadata.

If you are using the EPS variant, you clearly haven't read Appendix D of [Progressive Distillation for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00512), I mean, just look at that rotation from the noise to the image! Gorgeous!
