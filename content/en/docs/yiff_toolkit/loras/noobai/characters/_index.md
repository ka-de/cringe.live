title: "Characters"
summary: "Character LoRAs specialize in teaching Stable Diffusion models to generate consistent representations of specific characters, including their facial features, body proportions, clothing, and distinctive attributes. These adaptations are particularly popular in the AI art community for creating consistent representations of original characters, celebrities, or fictional personalities. Character LoRAs require careful curation of training data (typically 20-50 high-quality images) that clearly show the character's defining features from various angles and expressions. They primarily work by fine-tuning the model's attention mechanisms to maintain consistency in facial features, body proportions, and characteristic details while allowing for natural variations in poses and expressions. The training process often focuses on the upper layers of the model responsible for high-level feature recognition and generation."
