## Introduction

Forsburn is a mysterious warrior from the Rivals of Aether universe, a member of the Smoke Clan who wields the power of dark smoke in combat. After being exiled from his clan due to internal conflicts with his brother Zetterburn, he became a lone wanderer seeking to master the darker aspects of flame manipulation. His abilities revolve around creating smoke screens, summoning clones, and wielding a deadly smoke-forged dagger.

In appearance, Forsburn is a tall, imposing hyena with a distinctive dark gray fur coat adorned with ashen markings. His most striking features are his fiery mane and tail, which smolder with dark flames that twist and coil with his movements. He wears a tattered cloak that constantly billows with the dark smoke he commands, adding to his enigmatic presence. His piercing eyes glow ominously through the smoke, complemented by tribal-like markings on his face. Sharp claws and a lean, athletic build speak to his prowess as a warrior, while his overall demeanor remains brooding and calculated, befitting his role as a master of shadow and deception.
