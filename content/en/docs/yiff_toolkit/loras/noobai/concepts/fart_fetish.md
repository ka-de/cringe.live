# fart_fetish-v2s3000

---

## Introduction

---

It's a symphony of the body's natural processes, a reminder of our shared roots. It's the body's way of saying, "I'm alive, I'm functioning, and I'm unapologetically me." There's a certain poetry in its spontaneity, a raw honesty that cuts through the pretense. It's a moment of pure, unfiltered existence, a testament to the beauty of being a furry.

## Prompting Guide

---

I am absolutely certain `fart fetish` isn't needed, but that shouldn't stop you from typing it in for CLIP though. It deserves it! `presenting hindquarters`, `brown fart cloud` and `looking back at viewer` is worth a lot more.

If you get a nice composition, but the text in the cloud is ruining it, try reinforcing the attention with background elements or character details present in the generation but aren't prompted, instead of changing the seed or even worse, trying to Photoshop it.

    alt="This is a CGI rendering of an anthropomorphic hyena character dressed as a French maid created with high detail using digital art software. The subject has light brown fur adorned with darker spots typical of a spotted hyena's pattern along with a distinctive mane-like tuft around its neck and head. It stands facing away from us but turns slightly to glance over its shoulder. The outfit consists of a classic black-and-white French maid uniform featuring puffed sleeves ruffled trim on the apron and a large white bow tied at the back. The figure's physique includes humanized features such as pronounced buttocks and muscular limbs indicative of both feline and humanoid characteristics. Its tail is visible peeking out beneath the short skirt of the dress. In terms of background setting it appears to be inside a cozy bedroom bathed in natural sunlight streaming through arched windows draped with sheer curtains. A neatly made bed with white linens occupies the center-left side of the room while framed artwork hangs on muted green walls that add warmth to the scene. Overall the composition blends elements of realism with fantasy emphasizing texture details like fur patterns and fabric folds meticulously rendered in the illustration."

        alt="This is a digital illustration depicting an anthropomorphic hyena character styled as a maid. The scene takes place indoors with sunlight streaming through large arched windows covered partially by green curtains on the right side of the background. The hyena has light brown fur with dark spots typical to its species. It stands confidently facing away from the viewer but turns its head over its shoulder gazing directly at them. Its body is muscular yet feminine emphasizing broad shoulders and a curvy rear end which is prominently displayed due to the short black dress it wears. The outfit consists of a traditional French maid costume—a short-sleeved black dress trimmed with white lace around the edges including ruffles adorning the sleeves neckline and waistline. A large white bow ties neatly under her bust line while another smaller one rests above her left hip. Her tail peeks out slightly from beneath the skirt's hem adding to the overall aesthetic. In terms of accessories she sports thigh-high stockings that match the dress along with black shoes peeking just below her hemline. On the bed behind her there’s a rumpled blanket suggesting recent activity or rest. Above the bed hangs a framed picture though details about the artwork within aren’t visible. The room features muted pastel tones enhancing the softness of the setting against the vivid colors of her attire. This detailed depiction blends realistic textures and exaggerated proportions characteristic of fantasy art."

        alt="This is a digital illustration featuring an anthropomorphic canine character with exaggerated cartoonish proportions. The subject has tan fur on their face chest belly inner thighs and tail tip contrasting against darker brown or black fur covering most of its body. They have large expressive eyes pointed ears and a fluffy bushy tail raised high. The scene takes place outdoors near what appears to be a small red doghouse with a slanted roof situated within a fenced yard filled with green grass. The ground beneath the doghouse shows a significant amount of yellow liquid splattered around suggesting recent activity. This liquid substance is also visible pooling at the base where the character stands. From behind the character's buttocks dominate the foreground drawn larger than life with detailed shading that highlights curvature and volume. The perspective emphasizes the roundness and size of these features prominently. In terms of clothing there isn't any mentioned; however the focus remains solely on the figure itself without additional context about attire. There’s no indication of gender-specific traits other than general anatomical characteristics typical of canines. Overall the style of art leans towards anime-inspired furry artwork characterized by bold lines vibrant colors and attention-grabbing anatomy. It combines elements of both playful fantasy and explicit content due to the nature of the depicted scenario."
