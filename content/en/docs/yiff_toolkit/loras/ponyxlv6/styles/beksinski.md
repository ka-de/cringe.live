## Introduction

---

Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski (24 February 1929 ‚Äì 21 February 2005) was a renowned Polish artist known for his distinctive style of dystopian surrealism. He had no formal training as an artist but was a graduate of the Faculty of Architecture at the Krak√≥w Polytechnic. Beksi≈Ñski‚Äôs creations, which he referred to as either Baroque or Gothic, were made mainly in two periods. The first period is characterized by expressionistic color and surreal architecture, often depicting a doomsday scenario. The second period saw a more abstract style, with the main features of formalism. Beksi≈Ñski‚Äôs work often depicted disturbing images of death, decay, and desolate landscapes filled with skeletons and deformed figures. Tragically, Beksi≈Ñski was stabbed to death at his Warsaw apartment in 2005.
