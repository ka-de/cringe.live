## Introduction

---

Lovander is a sexy salamander from Palworld. It stands tall with a primarily light pink color. One of the most distinctive features of Lovander is its long, smooth hair that grows from the center of its head. Adding to its charm is a big pink heart located right in its chest. Its hands are thin, with fingers and wrist cuffs on both sides. Moreover, Lovander has two ribbon-like tails with a dark pink color and the same pattern at its groin.
