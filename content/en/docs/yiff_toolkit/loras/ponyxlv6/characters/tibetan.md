## Introduction

The Tibetan Sand Fox (Vulpes ferrilata) is a unique species of true fox endemic to the high Tibetan Plateau, Ladakh plateau, Nepal, China, Sikkim, and Bhutan. They are characterized by their distinct square head, which is different from the elongated head of most other fox species. These foxes are small and compact, with a soft, dense coat, a conspicuously narrow muzzle, and a bushy tail. Their fur varies in coloration, ranging from sandy or reddish-brown to gray, blending seamlessly with the desert surroundings. They primarily inhabit semi-arid to arid grasslands, well away from humans or from heavy vegetation cover. The Tibetan fox primarily preys on plateau pikas, followed by rodents, marmots, woolly hares, rabbits, small ground birds, and lizards. Despite their static population, they are often hunted down by locals for their fur.
