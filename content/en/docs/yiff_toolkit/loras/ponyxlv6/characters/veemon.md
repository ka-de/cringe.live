## Introduction

Veemon is a humanoid, lizard-like creature standing about 2-feet tall. It has predominantly blue skin, contrasted by a white belly and mouth. Veemon's head is large and roughly spherical, with two conical, fleshy appendages attached to the back, possibly serving as ears. A distinctive feature of Veemon is a small horn that protrudes where its nose would be. It also has red eyes and a yellow "V"-shaped mark on its forehead. This unique appearance contributes to Veemon's charm and recognizability in the Digimon universe.
