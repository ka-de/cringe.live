## Introduction

---

Trained a LoRA on a bunch of screenshots from Minit which turned out to be really useful for reducing the palette and details when generating pixel art in a computationally expensive but pretty impressive way. I also greatly enjoy the "MMDiT" style dithering it can occasionally produce.

The character stands in front of shelves filled with books that have various spines visible against a solid black background. The fox holds up one paw while speaking through a speech bubble at the top which reads 'I FOUND A WAY TO FIT IN YOUR VARM!'. The style uses monochromatic colors primarily in shades of gray on a black backdrop giving it a retro video game aesthetic."
