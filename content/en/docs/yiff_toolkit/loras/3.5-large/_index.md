title: "Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large"
summary: "Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large represents a significant advancement in the Stable Diffusion model family, building upon the success of its predecessors. This model introduces improved image generation capabilities with enhanced understanding of text prompts, better composition, and more accurate rendering of human features including hands and faces. It utilizes a larger parameter count and more sophisticated architecture compared to earlier versions, resulting in higher quality outputs and better coherence in complex scenes. The model demonstrates particular strengths in artistic compositions, and handling intricate details in both natural and synthetic scenes. It maintains SDXL's base resolution capabilities while offering improved prompt adherence and more consistent style reproduction across different types of generations."
