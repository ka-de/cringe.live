# Splines vs Straight

---

When building I tend to switch to `Splines` but while I'm generating, I usually switch back to `Straight`, as I find it less distracting while I'm just moving around the workflow and a bit more easier to follow between already placed nodes, while `Splines` are easier to follow when I'm building out a workflow.
