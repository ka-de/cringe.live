## Introduction

---

If I wrote this guide sooner, this would have been a super complicated chapter, but thankfully, with [xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0](https://huggingface.co/xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0) I don't really need to yap all day, I can just explain all of them at once, and all you need to do is download [this](https://huggingface.co/xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0/resolve/main/diffusion_pytorch_model_promax.safetensors), rename it to something meaningful like `xinsir-union-sdxl-1.0_promax.safetensors` and put it inside `models/controlnet`.
