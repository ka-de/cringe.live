    alt="The image depicts an anthropomorphic white wolf with green eyes, donning a purple wizard hat and cape with gold trims and a red gem. The character is pointing up with a defensive expression, accompanied by a speech bubble that reads, “I’M NOT A FURRY!” This visual is set against a transparent background, highlighting the colorful character. The humor in this image arises from the irony of the character’s statement. The term “furry” refers to individuals who have an interest in anthropomorphic animal characters, often dressing up as one or appreciating art related to them. Despite the character’s adamant denial, it ironically embodies the very essence of what it claims not to be—a furry, complete with human-like expression and attire typically associated with the furry fandom. This contradiction between the character’s statement and its appearance creates a humorous juxtaposition."

    alt="The image showcases three anthropomorphic wolves, each dressed in unique and elaborate costumes, standing in front of an American flag. The wolf in the center is adorned in a purple wizard’s robe and hood, holding a raised and clenched fist, adding a mystical and powerful touch to its appearance. The wolf on the left is wearing a blue suit, splattered with red blood. While the American flag is falling down upside down. The wolf on the right contrasts with a more authoritative look, dressed in a police uniform minus the shirt, revealing a muscular chest design, complete with an officer’s badge. The detailed costumes of these characters bring out their distinct personalities, from the mystical and magical to the patriotic and authoritative. The fur textures are realistic, enhancing the lifelike appearance of the wolves. The backdrop of a clear blue sky and the American flag adds a sense of celebration or national pride to the scene, making the image both striking and memorable."

## Site News

### 10/24/2024

Placeholder loading images, also known as BlurHash has been implemented for the site. The code used to encode the images can be found [here](https://github.com/ka-de/blurhash) which is a de-WASM'd and async version of [fpapado/blurhash-rust-wasm](https://github.com/fpapado/blurhash-rust-wasm), for the frontend part I went with [mad-gooze/fast-blurhash](https://github.com/mad-gooze/fast-blurhash).

### 10/11/2024
