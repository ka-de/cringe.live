## Introduction

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies linear sets of equations and their transformation properties. It revolves around the concept of vectors, which are elements of a vector space. A vector space (or linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which can be added together and multiplied by scalars (real or complex numbers). Key concepts in linear algebra include matrices, determinants, and eigenvalues. Matrices represent linear transformations, which are functions between vector spaces that preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication. Determinants provide important information about a matrix, such as whether it is invertible (i.e., there exists a matrix that undoes the transformation represented by the original matrix).

An eigenvector of a square matrix is a non-zero vector that, when the matrix is multiplied by it, yields a scalar multiple of itself. This scalar is known as the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have numerous applications, including in systems of differential equations, physics, engineering, and computer science. For instance, in Google’s PageRank algorithm, which is used to rank web pages in their search engine results, the web pages’ ranks are the components of an eigenvector of a matrix whose elements represent links between pages. Linear algebra is also essential in machine learning and data science, where it is used to handle and manipulate high-dimensional data.
