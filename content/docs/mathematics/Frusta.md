## Introduction

---

The term "frusta" is the plural form of "frustum," which is a geometric term. A **frustum** refers to the portion of a solid—usually a cone or a pyramid—that remains after cutting off the top by a plane parallel to the base. It can also be the part of the solid that is intercepted between two such parallel planes. The word originates from the Latin "frustum," meaning "piece cut off" and has been used in English since the mid 17th century. In geometry, the formula to calculate the volume \(V\) of a frustum of a cone or pyramid is given by:

$$ V = \frac{1}{3} h (A_1 + A_2 + \sqrt{A_1 A_2}) $$

where:

- \( h \) is the height of the frustum,
- \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) are the areas of the two parallel faces.
