# Verbose Cargo Logging

---

In Rust, Cargo is the package manager that also serves as a build system. The `CARGO_LOG` environment variable is used to control the logging of Cargo‚Äôs internal operations. When you set `CARGO_LOG="cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint=info"`, you‚Äôre specifically instructing Cargo to log information related to the compiler‚Äôs fingerprinting process. Fingerprinting in this context refers to how Cargo decides whether a particular component of your project needs to be recompiled. By setting the log level to `info`, you‚Äôre asking Cargo to provide more detailed logs about this process, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the build process better.

This will let you know why stuff keeps recompiling. üê±

```bash
CARGO_LOG="cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint=info"
```
