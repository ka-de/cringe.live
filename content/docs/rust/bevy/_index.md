## Introduction

---

Bevy is an open-source, data-driven game engine built in Rust that emphasizes simplicity, performance, and ergonomics. It leverages Rust’s safety and concurrency features to provide a reliable and efficient development experience. Bevy’s Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture enables high-performance game logic and rendering, making it suitable for both 2D and 3D games.

The engine’s modular design allows developers to use only the components they need, reducing bloat and increasing flexibility. Bevy’s hot reloading capability streamlines the development process by allowing changes to be seen in real-time without restarting the game. Its beginner-friendly approach, coupled with extensive documentation and a welcoming community, makes it an attractive option for both new and experienced game developers.

Bevy’s asset management system simplifies the handling of game resources, and its built-in tools for animation, audio, and input handling provide a comprehensive toolkit for game creation. The engine also supports WebAssembly, enabling games to run in web browsers with near-native performance.
