# Myopia

---

**Myopia** is a common vision condition in which you can see objects near to you clearly, but objects farther away appear blurry. It occurs when the shape of your eye causes light rays to bend (refract) incorrectly, focusing the images in front of the retina instead of directly on the retina.

There are several factors that could contribute to the development of myopia. These include:

1. **Genetics**: Myopia tends to run in families. If one or both parents are myopic, the risk of developing myopia is increased.

2. **Environmental factors**: Some studies suggest that reading and close-up work, such as using a computer or smartphone, might increase the risk of developing myopia.

3. **Age**: Myopia can develop in early childhood and it may progress gradually or rapidly. In most cases, the condition stabilizes in early adulthood but sometimes it continues to progress with age.

Symptoms of myopia include blurry distance vision, squinting, eye strain and headaches. Feeling fatigued when driving or playing sports also can be a symptom of uncorrected myopia.

Myopia is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam. Testing, with special emphasis on refraction, is done to determine the appropriate lens power needed to compensate for any refractive error (nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism).

The treatment goal for myopia is to improve vision. Depending on the degree of myopia, eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery can correct myopia.
