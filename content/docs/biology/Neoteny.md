# Neoteny

Neoteny is a biological term that refers to the retention of juvenile or immature characteristics into adulthood. It is a phenomenon observed in various species, including humans and other animals.

In the context of biology and development, neoteny occurs when certain traits or features that are typically associated with the juvenile stage of an organism persist into its adult stage. These retained juvenile characteristics can include physical traits, behaviors, or developmental patterns.

Some examples of neoteny in humans and animals include:

1. **Physical Features**: In some species, adults may retain physical features that are usually seen in juveniles. For example, certain salamanders retain gill structures into adulthood, which are typically present only in the larval stage.

2. **Behavior**: Neotenic behavior can involve the continuation of juvenile behaviors into adulthood. In humans, this might include curiosity, playfulness, and a willingness to learn throughout one's life.

3. **Developmental Patterns**: In humans, the extended period of childhood and adolescence compared to other primates is an example of neoteny in terms of developmental patterns. Human brains continue to develop and change well into early adulthood, which is not the case in many other primates.

Neoteny can have significant implications in evolutionary biology and can contribute to the diversification and adaptation of species over time. It is a concept often discussed in the context of evolutionary theory and the study of developmental biology.
