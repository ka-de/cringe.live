## Introduction

Biology is a natural science that involves the study of life and living organisms. It explores various aspects of life, from the smallest bio-molecules to the vast complexity of ecosystems. The discipline is broad and includes many branches such as biochemistry, ecology, genetics, evolutionary biology, and more. It investigates the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of living entities. It also seeks to understand the intricate mechanisms of life at different levels, ranging from molecular interactions within cells to the interactions of organisms within their environment. This scientific exploration contributes significantly to our understanding of the natural world and forms the basis for advancements in medicine, biotechnology, conservation, and many other disciplines.
