# Hypermetropia

---

Hypermetropia, also known as **farsightedness** or **long-sightedness**, is a common type of refractive error where distant objects may be seen more clearly than objects that are near. However, people experience hypermetropia differently. Some people may not notice any problems with their vision, especially when they are young. For people with significant hypermetropia, vision can be blurry for objects at any distance, near or far.

It occurs when the eyeball is too short or the cornea (the clear front cover of the eye) is too flat, so the light entering the eye isn't focused correctly. Instead of focusing on the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye), light is focused behind the retina. This results in close objects appearing blurry.

Hypermetropia is usually present at birth and tends to run in families. It can be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery.
