[GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/download/) is a powerful open-source graph visualization software. It provides a way to represent structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. Graphviz has several main graph layout programs, such as dot, neato, fdp, sfdp, twopi, and circo. These take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and create diagrams in several useful formats such as images and SVG for web pages, Postscript for inclusion in PDF or other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes. Itâ€™s widely used in a variety of applications including software engineering, networking, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for many other domains.
