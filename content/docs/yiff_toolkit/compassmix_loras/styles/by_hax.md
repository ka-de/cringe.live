## Introduction

---

The art style of Lofi & Kenket, collectively known as hax, is a unique blend of anthropomorphism and realism. Their artwork often features animal characters with human-like postures and expressions, set in scenes that balance between the fantastical and the everyday. The use of soft shading and a muted color palette contributes to a dreamy, serene atmosphere that is signature to their work. The attention to detail in textures‚Äîsuch as fur, clothing, and environmental elements‚Äîadds depth and richness to each piece.

In terms of composition, hax tends to create images with dynamic interactions between characters that convey a narrative or emotion without the need for words. There‚Äôs an emphasis on lighting and perspective that gives their scenes a cinematic quality. This storytelling through imagery invites viewers into intimate moments in the lives of the characters portrayed, often evoking a sense of nostalgia or contemplation.
