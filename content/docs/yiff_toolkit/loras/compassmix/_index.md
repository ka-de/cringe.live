title: "CompassMix XL Lightning LoRAs"
summary: "CompassMix Lightning is a refined SDXL-based model developed by frosting.ai, designed to deliver high-quality image generation in significantly fewer steps than traditional models. Distinguished by its ability to produce detailed outputs in just 2-8 steps while maintaining SDXL's high resolution standards, it strikes an optimal balance between generation speed and image quality. The model features enhanced prompt adherence and supports ControlNet compatibility, making it particularly valuable for users who need quick yet high-quality image generation capabilities. This list contains all the LoRAs I have released for this model."
