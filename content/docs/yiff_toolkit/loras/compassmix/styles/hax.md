## Introduction

---

Lofi & Kenket's artistic style, known as hax, combines anthropomorphic and realistic elements. Their work typically features animal characters with human-like poses and facial expressions, set against backgrounds that blend fantasy and reality. The use of soft shading and muted colors creates a calming, ethereal ambiance characteristic of their art. The attention to detail in textures, such as fur, clothing, and environmental elements, adds depth and complexity to each piece.

In terms of composition, hax's images often depict dynamic character interactions that convey a narrative or emotion without relying on text. The emphasis on lighting and perspective gives their scenes a cinematic feel. This visual storytelling invites viewers into the personal moments of the characters, often eliciting feelings of nostalgia or introspection.
