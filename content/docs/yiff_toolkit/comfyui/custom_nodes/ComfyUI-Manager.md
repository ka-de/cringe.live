# ComfyUI-Manager

So, you got ComfyUI installed? Is it working? Great! Now, close it! It's time to install more things!

[ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) is an extension that adds a bunch of stuff on top of ComfyUI, like, letting you install custom nodes and models, it is so useful, I have no idea why it's still not implemented in ComfyUI.. But who cares, you can just install it and use it!

```bash
cd custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager
```

Now, when you start ComfyUI again, you should immediately notice an ugly Share button. Thankfully, it can be easily disabled in the Manager menu, which you can open by clicking on th Manager button above the share button.

<div style="display: flex;">

While you are here, you might as well enable `Badges`, which are little labels on the top right corner of each node, letting you know their IDs and which custom node they belong to and set the `Preview Method` to `TAESD`, so you can see what is currently being generated by the KSampler.

Now, let's check out the Custom Nodes Manager together quick, which is a very convenient way to search and install custom nodes for ComfyUI.

Use the search bar to type in `Custom Scripts` and find the one made by `pythongosssss` and click the black `Install` button to install it. Once it is installed, you will be prompted to `Restart` ComfyUI. You should do so, and also hit Refresh in your browser `Ctrl + R` or `F5` every time you install a new custom script!
