# ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts

---

A bunch of useful and less useful custom nodes and it also changes up a bit the look of the interface, I think, for the better. One thing I don't recommend you even try out is the node auto arranging, since it will just end up jumbling it in a silly manner. You should always take care of your nodes manually with autism and plenty of OCD!

## Autocomplete

## Always Snap to Grid

---

It will be like holding `Shift` while moving nodes and groups, without actually having to hold down `Shift`. Genius!

## PlaySound and SystemNotification

---

These two nodes play a sound and display a notification every time something ran through them. It's super useful if you have a slow GPU or if you are working on animations and things just take a while to cook!

## Image Feed

---

This adds a panel to the bottom of ComfyUI that lets you see the output images. Combine this with the new Beta UI, and you have the ultimate interface!

## Preset Text and Show Text

---

The `Preset Text` node lets you create your own preset text, which you can then reuse easily and the `Show Text` node let's you easily debug your text related shenanigans with ComfyUI by displaying them.

## Workflow Image

---

This lets you export your workflow as an SVG or PNG file. Very handy!
