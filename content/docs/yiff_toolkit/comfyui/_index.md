# ComfyUI for Complete Idiots

---

## Introduction

---

First, sorry about the title, I just wanted to clickbait you! This is an actual proper guide from start to finish without any AI generated non-sense.
If you need help installing ComfyUI, you didn't come to the right place. Please check out the [Installing](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI?tab=readme-ov-file#installing) section of the readme, and come back here when you got it running.

## Node Based Workflow

---

Let's get nodes and workflows out of the way quick! When you open up ComfyUI for the first time you are greeted with the following arcane wizardry:

![Arcane Wizardry](/images/comfyui/arcane_wizardry.png)

It could be a bit daunting at first to wrap your head around all these new concepts, especially when this is the first time you encounter a node based workflow, so much so, that you might feel the need to hop onto Discord, and publicly let 30k people know that you are too dumb to learn ComfyUI and that ComfyUI sucks and that everybody who is trying to help your dumb ass is just a troll! But fuck that! You are stronger than that! Besides, you have üê∫ü™Ñ (me) here to help you get through this shit, quick and easy!

The workflow is the whole thing in the previous screenshot, every node, group and connections you have made, together form this esoteric JSON beast, when people tell you to share your workflow, they mean really mean for you is to hit `Ctrl + S` and send them the JSON file you downloaded after naming your workflow something meaningful. You can also use [Workflow Image](/docs/yiff_toolkit/comfyui/#workflow-image) from the Custom-Scripts custom node, to embed the workflow in an image of your workflow.

Now let's start from the beginning!

If you are using the new menu, you need two clicks, first on the current workflow, and then on the `Blank` button.

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Blank Workflow With New Menu](/images/comfyui/blank_workflow_with_new_menu.png)

</div>

If you are sticking with the old menu, you'll find it here:

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Clear Button](/images/comfyui/clear_button.png)

</div>

## Splines vs Straight

---

When building I tend to switch to `Splines` but while I'm generating, I usually switch back to `Straight`, as I find it less distracting while I'm just moving around the workflow and a bit more easier to follow between already placed nodes, while `Splines` are easier to follow when I'm building out a workflow.

![Splines vs Straight](/images/comfyui/splines_vs_straight.png)

## ComfyUI-Manager

---

So, you got ComfyUI installed? Is it working? Great! Now, close it! It's time to install more things!

[ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) is an extension that adds a bunch of stuff on top of ComfyUI, like, letting you install custom nodes and models, it is so useful, I have no idea why it's still not implemented in ComfyUI.. But who cares, you can just install it and use it!

```bash
cd custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager
```

Now, when you start ComfyUI again, you should immediately notice an ugly Share button. Thankfully, it can be easily disabled in the Manager menu, which you can open by clicking on th Manager button above the share button.

<div style="display: flex;">

![Ugly share button.](/images/comfyui/ugly_share_button.png)

![Manager Menu](/images/comfyui/manager_menu_share.png)

</div>

While you are here, you might as well enable `Badges`, which are little labels on the top right corner of each node, letting you know their IDs and which custom node they belong to and set the `Preview Method` to `TAESD`, so you can see what is currently being generated by the KSampler.

Now, let's check out the Custom Nodes Manager together quick, which is a very convenient way to search and install custom nodes for ComfyUI.

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Custom Nodes Manager](/images/comfyui/custom_nodes_manager.png)

</div>

Use the search bar to type in `Custom Scripts` and find the one made by `pythongosssss` and click the black `Install` button to install it. Once it is installed, you will be prompted to `Restart` ComfyUI. You should do so, and also hit Refresh in your browser `Ctrl + R` or `F5` every time you install a new custom script!

## ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts

---

Alright, now that I made you install this custom node, I guess I should mention what it does exactly! Its a bundle of a bunch of useful and less useful custom nodes and it also changes up a lot of the interface. One thing I don't recommend you even try out is the node auto arranging, since it will just end up jumbling it in a silly manner. You should take care of your nodes manually with autism and plenty of OCD!

### Autocomplete

### Always Snap to Grid

---

It will be like holding `Shift` while moving nodes and groups, without actually having to hold down `Shift`. Genius!

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Always Snap to Grid](/images/comfyui/always_snap_to_grid.png)

</div>

### PlaySound and SystemNotification

---

These two nodes play a sound and display a notification every time something ran through them. It's super useful if you have a slow GPU or if you are working on animations and things just take a while to cook!

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Sound and Notification](/images/comfyui/sound_and_notification.png)

</div>

### Image Feed

---

This adds a panel to the bottom of ComfyUI that lets you see the output images. Combine this with the new Beta UI, and you have the ultimate interface!

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Image Feed Settings](/images/comfyui/imagefeed_settings.png)

</div>

### Preset Text and Show Text

---

The `Preset Text` node lets you create your own preset text, which you can then reuse easily and the `Show Text` node let's you easily debug your text related shenanigans with ComfyUI by displaying them.

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Text Nodes](/images/comfyui/text_nodes.png)

</div>

### Workflow Image

---

This lets you export your workflow as an SVG or PNG file. Very handy!

## ComfyUI-Prediction

---

Another cool custom node. You need to set it up like this for Avoid and Erase:

<!--
I'll be honest, I have to sit down one day and go through it one more time. This is just too much for my üê∫üß†!
-->

![Prediction Avoid and Erase](/images/comfyui/prediction_avoid_and_erase.png)

But in order for you to really start understanding what this custom node does, let's recreate first the CFG prediction:

![Recreating CFG Prediction](/images/comfyui/recreating_cfg_prediction.png)

But now that you have built it out, lets select all of it while holding `Ctrl`, and deleting the whole thing, because this was just mostly meant for education purposes.

If you want to use CFG Prediction, you might be better off with using the default setup with the default KSampler and all so you can benefit from model patches and whatever.

You might also want to take a look at Perp-Neg and the multiple ways it is implemented in ComfyUI, hell, with this, you can even set it up yourself.

It would look something like this:

![Bootleg Perp-Neg](/images/comfyui/bootleg_perp-neg.png)

<!--
You can even do this evil thing:

![Evil Thing](/images/comfyui/evil_thing.png)

I'm not sure if its a good idea, I can think of at least one reason why this is a good idea, but I'm just a üê∫!
-->

You can also build it out like this:

![Another Prediction](/images/comfyui/another_prediction.png)

And here is yet another weird prediction model you can build out, which results in pretty awesome images:

## ControlNet

---

If I wrote this guide sooner, this would have been a super complicated chapter, but thankfully, with [xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0](https://huggingface.co/xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0) I don't really need to yap all day, I can just explain all of them at once, and all you need to do is download [this](https://huggingface.co/xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0/resolve/main/diffusion_pytorch_model_promax.safetensors), rename it to something meaningful like `xinsir-union-sdxl-1.0_promax.safetensors` and put it inside `models/controlnet`, download
