    alt="This is an anthropomorphic digital drawing featuring Amicus a male character with grayish-blue fur and white patches on his face chest inner arms hands feet and tail tip. He has large erect ears and blue eyes standing confidently against a mountainous landscape under a clear sky. His physique is muscular but slightly chubby around the midsection. Amicus wears only minimal clothing; he sports a red cape draped over his shoulders and no other garments except a small pouch hanging between his legs that covers part of his genitals which remain partially exposed. The scene includes lush greenery and rolling hills in the distance with visible mountains behind him. There's also a river winding through the valley below. The style of art leans towards comic or cartoon illustration characterized by bold lines and vibrant colors typical of modern furry fandom artwork. This detailed depiction captures both the subject‚Äôs anatomy and the serene natural environment vividly"

Amicus is a central character in the visual novel Adastra. He is a wolf-like alien from the moon Adastra and the heir to the Wolven imperial throne. Standing at approximately 7 feet tall and weighing around 300lb, Amicus has a large, robust physique typical of his species. He is known for his outgoing and optimistic personality, although his life within the palace walls can often feel suffocating and lonely. Despite this, he maintains a strong sense of duty to his throne and birthright, and is determined to prove himself over his brother, Cassius. Amicus is also known for his impulsive tendencies, which often lead him into trouble. However, he finds joy in making friends, including the protagonist, who he quickly develops a romantic interest in.
