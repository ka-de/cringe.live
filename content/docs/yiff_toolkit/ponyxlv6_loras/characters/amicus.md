## Introduction

---

Amicus is a central character in the visual novel Adastra. He is a wolf-like alien from the moon Adastra and the heir to the Wolven imperial throne. Standing at approximately 7 feet tall and weighing around 300lb, Amicus has a large, robust physique typical of his species. He is known for his outgoing and optimistic personality, although his life within the palace walls can often feel suffocating and lonely. Despite this, he maintains a strong sense of duty to his throne and birthright, and is determined to prove himself over his brother, Cassius. Amicus is also known for his impulsive tendencies, which often lead him into trouble. However, he finds joy in making friends, including the protagonist, who he quickly develops a romantic interest in.
