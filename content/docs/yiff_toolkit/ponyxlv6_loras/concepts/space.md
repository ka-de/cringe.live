## Introduction

---

Space, the final frontier, is a vast and mysterious expanse that has fascinated humanity for centuries. It is a realm where stars are born, galaxies collide, and black holes devour everything in their path. Our understanding of space has grown exponentially thanks to advancements in technology and the tireless efforts of astronomers and scientists. Among the most significant tools in our quest to explore the cosmos are space telescopes, which allow us to peer into the depths of the universe and uncover its secrets.

Two of the most renowned space telescopes are the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, has provided us with breathtaking images and invaluable data, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. It has captured stunning views of distant galaxies, nebulae, and even our own solar system. The James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch soon, is poised to take over Hubble‚Äôs legacy. With its advanced technology and larger mirror, JWST will be able to see further into the past, capturing the light from the first galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. Together, these telescopes represent humanity‚Äôs unending curiosity and determination to explore the cosmos.

## Prompting Guide

---

Keywords:

- `by hubble`
- `by jwst`

```r
# Here, using `photo` will sometimes randomly add really distorted hands.
a galaxy, photo
```

This is the correct way to do it:

```r
by jwst, a red and blue galaxy
by hubble, a galaxy
```

### Suggested Negative

```md
cropped,

blurry, wtf, old art, where is your god now, abstract background, simple background, cropped
```
