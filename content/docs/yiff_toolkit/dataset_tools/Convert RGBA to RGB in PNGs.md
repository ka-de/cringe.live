# Convert RGBA to RGB in PNGs

This script automates the process of converting `.png` images from RGBA to RGB format in a specified directory, utilizing multiprocessing to enhance efficiency.

```python

import glob
import multiprocessing

    Convert an RGBA image to RGB format.

    This function opens an image from a given path and checks if it's in RGBA mode.
    If it is, the image is converted to RGB mode and saved back to the same path.
    Any errors encountered during processing are caught and printed.

    Parameters:
    - image_path (str): The file path of the image to be converted.

    Returns:
