# Search for Tag

---

This script is used to search for the word "anthrofied" in all .txt files within a specified directory and its subdirectories. It uses multiprocessing
to speed up the search by checking multiple files simultaneously.

```python
import glob
import os
import multiprocessing


def check_file(filename):
    """
    Checks if a .txt file contains the word "anthrofied".

    Args:
        filename (str): The path of the file to check.

    Returns:
        str: The filename if it contains "anthrofied", otherwise None.
    """
    # Skip 'sample-prompts.txt' and '*-sample-prompts.txt' files
    if os.path.basename(filename) == "sample-prompts.txt" or os.path.basename(
        filename
    ).endswith("-sample-prompts.txt"):
        return None
    # Open each text file and check if it contains the word "anthrofied"
    with open(filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        content = file.read()

    # Use glob to recursively find all .txt files
    filenames = glob.glob(path + "**/*.txt", recursive=True)
