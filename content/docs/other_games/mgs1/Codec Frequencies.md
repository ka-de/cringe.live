<div class="spoiler">In the later stages of the story, Meryl's codec breaks down and you lose the ability to call her. The game also has multiple endings, and depending on whether Meryl lives or dies, you receive different items in the New Game+ mode. If she survives, you receive the Bandana, which gives you unlimited ammo. If she doesn't survive, you receive the Stealth Suit.</div>
